# Snes9x NEO
*-By Sunlit and Chromius-*

SNES9x NEO is a modified version of SNES9x with the following additions:
- up to 20,000% SuperFX overclock
- Ultra CPU Overclock setting added
- Fast Forward Speed cap increased
Some games may not boot with ultra enabled, set cpu overclock to max, let the game boot, then turn on ultra overclock.

## Building
I've only compiled this for Windows, absolutely no clue if other platforms work at all.  
Good luck, I guess.
